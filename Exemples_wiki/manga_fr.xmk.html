            <p>In Japan, people of all ages read manga. The medium includes works in a broad range
               of genres: action-adventure, romance, sports and games, historical drama, comedy,
               science fiction and fantasy, mystery, suspense, detective, horror, sexuality, and
               business/commerce, among others. Since the 1950s, manga has steadily become a major part of the Japanese publishing
               industry, representing a 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen">¥</a>406 billion market in Japan in 2007 (approximately 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar">$</a>3.6 billion) and 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen">¥</a>420 billion (
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar">$</a>5.5 billion) in 2009. Manga have also gained a significant worldwide audience. In Europe and the Middle East the market is worth $250 million. In 2008, in the U.S. and Canada, the manga market was valued at $175 million. The
               markets in France and the United States are about the same size. Manga stories are
               typically printed in 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-and-white">black-and-white</a>, although some full-color manga exist (e.g.

               many stories, each presented in a single episode to be continued in the next issue.
               If the series is successful, collected chapters may be republished in

               with a creative editor from a commercial publishing company. If a manga series is popular enough, it may be 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime">animated</a> after or even during its run. Sometimes manga are drawn centering on previously existing live-action or animated
               films.

               <i>manga</i> in Japanese can be translated as "whimsical drawings" or "impromptu sketches." Originally an 18th-century 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Literati_painting">Chinese literati</a> term, the word first came into common usage in Japan in the late 18th century with the

               <i>Shiji no yukikai</i> (1798), and in the early 19th century with such works as Aikawa Minwa's

               to the usage of "anime" in and outside of Japan. The term "

         <div>
            <p>Modern manga originated in the Occupation (1945–1952) and post-Occupation years (1952–early
               1960s), while a previously militaristic and ultra-nationalist Japan rebuilt its political
               and economic infrastructure.

         <div>
            <p>Writers on manga history have described two broad and complementary processes shaping
               modern manga. One view emphasizes events occurring during and after the 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupied_Japan">U.S. Occupation of Japan</a> (1945–1952), and stresses U.S. cultural influences, including U.S. comics (brought
               to Japan by the 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/G.I._(military)">GIs</a>) and images and themes from U.S. television, film, and cartoons (especially 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company">Disney</a>). The other view, represented by other writers such as 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederik_L._Schodt">Frederik L. Schodt</a>, Kinko Ito, and Adam L. Kern, stress continuity of Japanese cultural and aesthetic
               traditions, including pre-war, 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_period">Meiji</a>, and

         <div>
            <p>Regardless of its source, an explosion of artistic creativity certainly occurred in
               the post-war period, involving manga artists such as

               <i>Astro Boy</i> quickly became (and remains) immensely popular in Japan and elsewhere, and the

               technique, the panels are like a motion picture that reveals details of action bordering
               on slow motion as well as rapid zooms from distance to close-up shots. This kind of
               visual dynamism was widely adopted by later manga artists. Hasegawa's focus on daily life and on women's experience also came to characterize
               later

               <i>shōjo</i> manga continued to develop stylistically while simultaneously evolving different

            <p>By 2007 the influence of manga on international comics had grown considerably over
               the past two decades. "Influence" is used here to refer to effects on the comics markets outside of Japan
               and to 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetic">aesthetic</a> effects on comics artists internationally.
            </p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <p>Traditionally, manga stories flow from top to bottom and from 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_and_vertical_writing_in_East_Asian_scripts">right to left</a>. Some publishers of translated manga keep to this original format. Other publishers
               mirror the pages horizontally before printing the translation, changing the reading
               direction to a more "Western" left to right, so as not to confuse foreign readers
               or traditional comics-consumers. This practice is known as "flipping". For the most part, criticism suggests that flipping goes against the original intentions
               of the creator (for example, if a person wears a shirt that reads "MAY" on it, and
               gets flipped, then the word is altered to "YAM"), who may be ignorant of how awkward
               it is to read comics when the eyes must flow through the pages and text in opposite
               directions, resulting in an experience that's quite distinct from reading something
               that flows homogeneously. If the translation is not adapted to the flipped artwork
               carefully enough it is also possible for the text to go against the picture, such
               as a person referring to something on their left in the text while pointing to their
               right in the graphic. Characters shown writing with their right hands, the majority
               of them, would become left-handed when a series is flipped. Flipping may also cause
               oddities with familiar asymmetrical objects or layouts, such as a car being depicted
               with the gas pedal on the left and the brake on the right, or a shirt with the buttons
               on the wrong side, but these issues are minor when compared to the unnatural reading
               flow, and some of them could be solved with an adaptation work that goes beyond just
               translation and blind flipping.
