               <em>HTML</em> or 
               <em>HyperText Markup Language</em> is the standard 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">markup language</a> used to create 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page">web pages</a>.
            </p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <p>HTML is written in the form of 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element">HTML elements</a> consisting of 
               <i>tags</i> enclosed in 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_brackets">angle brackets</a> (like &lt;html&gt;). HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;/h1&gt;, although some tags represent 
               <i>empty elements</i> and so are unpaired, for example &lt;img&gt;. The first tag in a pair is the 
               <i>start tag</i>, and the second tag is the 
               <i>end tag</i> (they are also called 
               <i>opening tags</i> and 
               <i>closing tags</i>).
            </p>

            <p>A 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">web browser</a> can read HTML files and compose them into visible or audible web pages. The browser
               does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to interpret the content of the page.
               HTML describes the structure of a website 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic">semantically</a> along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language rather than a 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language">programming language</a>.
            </p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <p>HTML elements form the building blocks of all 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Website">websites</a>. HTML allows 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Img_(HTML_element)">images and objects</a> to be embedded and can be used to create 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Fieldset">interactive forms</a>. It provides a means to create 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_document">structured documents</a> by denoting structural 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic">semantics</a> for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">links</a>, quotes and other items. It can embed 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language">scripts</a> written in languages such as 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> which affect the behavior of HTML web pages.
            </p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <p>Web browsers can also refer to 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">Cascading Style Sheets</a> (CSS) to define the look and layout of text and other material. The 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/W3C">W3C</a>, maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, encourages the use of CSS over
               explicit presentational HTML.

               <p>In 1980, physicist 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, who was a contractor at 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN">CERN</a>, proposed and prototyped 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/ENQUIRE">ENQUIRE</a>, a system for 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN">CERN</a> researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing
                  an 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a>-based 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a> system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990.
                  That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cailliau">Robert Cailliau</a> collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted
                  by CERN. In his personal notes from 1990 he listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.

            <div>
               <p>The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",
                  first mentioned on the Internet by Berners-Lee in late 1991. It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML.
                  Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/SGMLguid">SGMLguid</a>, an in-house 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/SGML">SGML</a>-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML
                  4.

            <div>
               <p>HyperText Markup Language is a 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">markup language</a> that 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">web browsers</a> use to interpret and 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Typesetting">compose</a> text, images and other material into visual or audible web pages. Default characteristics
                  for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics
                  can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a>. Many of the text elements are found in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 
                  <i>Techniques for using SGML</i>, which in turn covers the features of early text formatting languages such as that
                  used by the 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/TYPSET_and_RUNOFF">RUNOFF command</a> developed in the early 1960s for the 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatible_Time-Sharing_System">CTSS</a> (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system: these formatting commands were
                  derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However,
                  the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges
                  with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with also the separation of structure
                  and markup; HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a>.
               </p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <p>Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined
                  as such by the 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification:
                  
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.orghttp://www.w3.org/MarkUp/draft-ietf-iiir-html-01.txt">"Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet-Draft</a> by Berners-Lee and 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Connolly_(computer_scientist)">Dan Connolly</a>, which included an SGML 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Type_Definition">Document Type Definition</a> to define the grammar. The draft expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the
                  
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)">NCSA Mosaic</a> browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy
                  of basing standards on successful prototypes. Similarly, 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Raggett">Dave Raggett</a>'s competing Internet-Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested
                  standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.
               </p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <p>After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working
                  Group, which in 1995 completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to
                  be treated as a standard against which future implementations should be based.
               </p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <p>Further development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests.
                  Since 1996, the HTML specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial
                  software vendors, by the 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C). However, in 2000, HTML also became an international standard (
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization">ISO</a>/
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Electrotechnical_Commission">IEC</a> 15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999, with further errata published
                  through 2001. In 2004 development began on HTML5 in the 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Hypertext_Application_Technology_Working_Group">Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group</a> (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with the W3C in 2008, and completed and
                  standardized on 28 October 2014.

            <p>HTML markup consists of several key components, including 
               <i>tags</i> (and their 
               <i>attributes</i>), character-based 
               <i>data types</i>, 
               <i>character references</i> and 
               <i>entity references</i>. Another important component is the

               <p>HTML documents imply a structure of nested 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element">HTML elements</a>. These are indicated in the document by HTML 
                  <i>tags</i>, enclosed in angle brackets thus: &lt;p&gt;
               </p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <p>In the simple, general case, the extent of an element is indicated by a pair of tags:
                  a 'start tag' &lt;p&gt; and 'end tag' . The text content of the element, if any, is placed between these
                  tags.
               </p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <p>Tags may also enclose further tag markup between the start and end, including a mixture
                  of tags and text. This indicates further, nested, elements, as children of the parent
                  element.
               </p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <p>The start tag may also include 
                  <i>attributes</i> within the tag. These indicate other information, such as identifiers for sections
                  within the document, identifiers used to bind style information to the presentation
                  of the document, and for some tags such as the &lt;img&gt; used to embed images, the reference to the image resource.
               </p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <p>Some elements, such as the 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_breaking_character">line break</a> &lt;br&gt;, do not permit 
                  <i>any</i> embedded content, either text or further tags. These require only a single empty
                  tag (akin to a start tag) and do not use an end tag.
               </p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <p>Many tags, particularly the closing end tag for the very commonly-used paragraph element
                  &lt;p&gt;, are optional. An HTML browser or other agent can infer the closure for the end of
                  an element from the context and the structural rules defined by the HTML standard.
                  These rules are complex and not widely understood by most HTML coders.

            </div>
            <div>
               <p>The general form of an 
                  <em>HTML element</em> is therefore: &lt;tag attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2"&gt;
                  <i>content</i>&lt;/tag&gt;. Some HTML elements are defined as 
                  <i>empty elements</i> and take the form &lt;tag attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2" &gt;. Empty elements may enclose no content, for instance, the BR tag or the inline IMG
                  tag. The name of an HTML element is the name used in the tags. Note that the end tag's
                  name is preceded by a slash character, "/", and that in empty elements the end tag
                  is neither required nor allowed. If attributes are not mentioned, default values are
                  used in each case.

               <p>There are several types of markup elements used in HTML:</p>

            <div>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     <p>Structural markup describes the purpose of text</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>
                           <p>For example, &lt;h2&gt;Golf&lt;/h2&gt; establishes "Golf" as a second-level 
                              <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element#Basic_text">heading</a>. Structural markup does not denote any specific rendering, but most web browsers
                              have default styles for element formatting. Content may be further styled using 
                              <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">Cascading Style Sheets</a> (CSS).
                           </p>
                        </li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>Presentational markup describes the appearance of the text, regardless of its purpose</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>
                           <p>For example &lt;b&gt;boldface&lt;/b&gt; indicates that visual output devices should render "boldface" in bold text, but gives
                              little indication what devices that are unable to do this (such as aural devices that
                              read the text aloud) should do. In the case of both &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt;, there are other elements that may have equivalent visual renderings but which are
                              more semantic in nature, such as &lt;strong&gt;strong text&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;emphasised text&lt;/em&gt; respectively. It is easier to see how an aural user agent should interpret the latter
                              two elements. However, they are not equivalent to their presentational counterparts:
                              it would be undesirable for a screen-reader to emphasize the name of a book, for instance,
                              but on a screen such a name would be italicized. Most presentational markup elements
                              have become 
                              <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Deprecation">deprecated</a> under the HTML 4.0 specification in favor of using 
                              <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a> for styling.

                     <p>Hypertext markup makes parts of a document into links to other documents</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>
                           <p>An anchor element creates a 
                              <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">hyperlink</a> in the document and its href attribute sets the link's target 
                              <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator">URL</a>. For example the HTML markup, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, will render the word "" as a hyperlink. To render an image as a hyperlink, an 'img' element is inserted
                              as content into the 'a' element. Like 'br', 'img' is an empty element with attributes
                              but no content or closing tag. &lt;a href="http://example.org"&gt;&lt;img src="image.gif" alt="descriptive text" width="50" height="50" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

            </div>
            <div>
               <p>Most of the attributes of an element are 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-value_pair">name-value pairs</a>, separated by "=" and written within the start tag of an element after the element's
                  name. The value may be enclosed in single or double quotes, although values consisting
                  of certain characters can be left unquoted in HTML (but not XHTML) . Leaving attribute values unquoted is considered unsafe. In contrast with name-value pair attributes, there are some attributes that affect
                  the element simply by their presence in the start tag of the element, like the ismap attribute for the img element.
               </p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <p>There are several common attributes that may appear in many elements :</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <ul>
                  
                  <li>
                     <p>The id attribute provides a document-wide unique identifier for an element. This is used
                        to identify the element so that stylesheets can alter its presentational properties,
                        and scripts may alter, animate or delete its contents or presentation. Appended to
                        the URL of the page, it provides a globally unique identifier for the element, typically
                        a sub-section of the page. For example, the ID "Attributes" in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#Attributes
                     </p>
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>
                     <p>The class attribute provides a way of classifying similar elements. This can be used for 
                        <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics">semantic</a> or presentation purposes. For example, an HTML document might semantically use the
                        designation class="notation" to indicate that all elements with this class value are subordinate to the main text
                        of the document. In presentation, such elements might be gathered together and presented
                        as footnotes on a page instead of appearing in the place where they occur in the HTML
                        source. Class attributes are used semantically in 
                        <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Microformat">microformats</a>. Multiple class values may be specified; for example class="notation important" puts the element into both the 'notation' and the 'important' classes.
                     </p>
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>
                     <p>An author may use the style attribute to assign presentational properties to a particular element. It is considered
                        better practice to use an element's id or class attributes to select the element from within a stylesheet, though sometimes this
                        can be too cumbersome for a simple, specific, or ad hoc styling.
                     </p>
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>
                     <p>The title attribute is used to attach subtextual explanation to an element. In most browsers
                        this attribute is displayed as a 
                        <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooltip">tooltip</a>.
                     </p>
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>
                     <p>The lang attribute identifies the natural language of the element's contents, which may be
                        different from that of the rest of the document. For example, in an English-language
                        document:

               <h1>Character and entity references</h1>
            </header>
            <div>
               <p>As of version 4.0, HTML defines a set of 252 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_entity_reference">character entity references</a> and a set of 1,114,050 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeric_character_reference">numeric character references</a>, both of which allow individual characters to be written via simple markup, rather
                  than literally. A literal character and its markup counterpart are considered equivalent
                  and are rendered identically.
               </p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <p>The ability to "escape" characters in this way allows for the characters &lt; and &amp; (when written as &amp;lt; and &amp;amp;, respectively) to be interpreted as character data, rather than markup. For example,
                  a literal &lt; normally indicates the start of a tag, and &amp; normally indicates the start of a character entity reference or numeric character
                  reference; writing it as &amp;amp; or &amp;#x26; or &amp;#38; allows &amp; to be included in the content of an element or in the value of an attribute. The
                  double-quote character ("), when not used to quote an attribute value, must also be escaped as &amp;quot; or &amp;#x22; or &amp;#34; when it appears within the attribute value itself. Equivalently, the single-quote
                  character ('), when not used to quote an attribute value, must also be escaped as &amp;#x27; or &amp;#39; (or as &amp;apos; in HTML5 or XHTML documents ) when it appears within the attribute value itself. If document authors overlook
                  the need to escape such characters, some browsers can be very forgiving and try to
                  use context to guess their intent. The result is still invalid markup, which makes
                  the document less accessible to other browsers and to other 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent">user agents</a> that may try to parse the document for 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler">search and indexing</a> purposes for example.
               </p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <p>Escaping also allows for characters that are not easily typed, or that are not available
                  in the document's 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding">character encoding</a>, to be represented within element and attribute content. For example, the acute-accented
                  e (é), a character typically found only on Western European and South American keyboards,
                  can be written in any HTML document as the entity reference &amp;eacute; or as the numeric references &amp;#xE9; or &amp;#233;, using characters that are available on all keyboards and are supported in all character
                  encodings. 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a> character encodings such as 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a> are compatible with all modern browsers and allow direct access to almost all the
                  characters of the world's writing systems.

            <div>
               <p>The original purpose of the doctype was to enable parsing and validation of HTML documents
                  by SGML tools based on the 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Type_Definition">Document Type Definition</a> (DTD). The DTD to which the DOCTYPE refers contains a machine-readable grammar specifying
                  the permitted and prohibited content for a document conforming to such a DTD. Browsers,
                  on the other hand, do not implement HTML as an application of SGML and by consequence
                  do not read the DTD.

            <div>
               <p>This declaration references the DTD for the 'strict' version of HTML 4.01. SGML-based
                  validators read the DTD in order to properly parse the document and to perform validation.
                  In modern browsers, a valid doctype activates standards mode as opposed to

                  or 'deprecated' tags, with the Strict DTD excluding deprecated tags. Frameset has
                  all tags necessary to make frames on a page along with the tags included in transitional
                  type

            <h1>Semantic HTML</h1>
         </header>
         <div>
            <p>Semantic HTML is a way of writing HTML that emphasizes the meaning of the encoded
               information over its presentation (look). HTML has included semantic markup from its
               inception, but has also included presentational markup, such as &lt;font&gt;, &lt;i&gt; and &lt;center&gt; tags. There are also the semantically neutral 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Span_and_div">span and div</a> tags. Since the late 1990s when 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">Cascading Style Sheets</a> were beginning to work in most browsers, web authors have been encouraged to avoid
               the use of presentational HTML markup with a view to the 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_presentation_and_content">separation of presentation and content</a>.
            </p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <p>In a 2001 discussion of the 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">Semantic Web</a>, Tim Berners-Lee and others gave examples of ways in which intelligent software 'agents'
               may one day automatically crawl the web and find, filter and correlate previously
               unrelated, published facts for the benefit of human users. Such agents are not commonplace even now, but some of the ideas of 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 2.0</a>, 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(web_application_hybrid)">mashups</a> and 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_comparison_service">price comparison websites</a> may be coming close. The main difference between these web application hybrids and
               Berners-Lee's semantic agents lies in the fact that the current 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed_aggregator">aggregation</a> and hybridization of information is usually designed in by 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_developer">web developers</a>, who already know the web locations and the 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">API semantics</a> of the specific data they wish to mash, compare and combine.
            </p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <p>An important type of web agent that does crawl and read web pages automatically, without
               prior knowledge of what it might find, is the 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler">web crawler</a> or search-engine spider. These software agents are dependent on the semantic clarity
               of web pages they find as they use various techniques and 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithms</a> to read and index millions of web pages a day and provide web users with 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search_engine">search facilities</a> without which the World Wide Web's usefulness would be greatly reduced.
            </p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <p>In order for search-engine spiders to be able to rate the significance of pieces of
               text they find in HTML documents, and also for those creating mashups and other hybrids
               as well as for more automated agents as they are developed, the semantic structures
               that exist in HTML need to be widely and uniformly applied to bring out the meaning
               of published text.
            </p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <p>Presentational markup tags are 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Deprecation">deprecated</a> in current HTML and XHTML recommendations and are illegal in HTML5.
            </p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <p>Good semantic HTML also improves the 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility">accessibility</a> of web documents (see also 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Content_Accessibility_Guidelines">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a>). For example, when a screen reader or audio browser can correctly ascertain the
               structure of a document, it will not waste the visually impaired user's time by reading
               out repeated or irrelevant information when it has been marked up correctly.

                  to HTML. To allow the web browser to know how to handle each document it receives,
                  other information is transmitted along with the document. This

            <h1>HTML4 variations</h1>
         </header>
         <div>
            <p>Since its inception, HTML and its associated protocols gained acceptance relatively
               quickly. However, no clear standards existed in the early years of the language. Though
               its creators originally conceived of HTML as a semantic language devoid of presentation
               details, practical uses pushed many presentational elements and attributes into the language,
               driven largely by the various browser vendors. The latest standards surrounding HTML
               reflect efforts to overcome the sometimes chaotic development of the language and to create a rational foundation for building both meaningful and well-presented
               documents. To return HTML to its role as a semantic language, the 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium">W3C</a> has developed style languages such as 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a> and 
               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Stylesheet_Language">XSL</a> to shoulder the burden of presentation. In conjunction, the HTML specification has
               slowly reined in the presentational elements.
            </p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <p>There are two axes differentiating various variations of HTML as currently specified:
               SGML-based HTML versus XML-based HTML (referred to as XHTML) on one axis, and strict
               versus transitional (loose) versus frameset on the other axis.
            </p>
         </div>
         <section>
            <header>
               <h1>SGML-based versus XML-based HTML</h1>
            </header>
            <div>
               <p>One difference in the latest HTML specifications lies in the distinction between the
                  SGML-based specification and the XML-based specification. The XML-based specification
                  is usually called 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML">XHTML</a> to distinguish it clearly from the more traditional definition. However, the root
                  element name continues to be 'html' even in the XHTML-specified HTML. The W3C intended
                  XHTML 1.0 to be identical to HTML 4.01 except where limitations of XML over the more
                  complex SGML require workarounds. Because XHTML and HTML are closely related, they
                  are sometimes documented in parallel. In such circumstances, some authors 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/(X)HTML">conflate the two names</a> as (X)HTML or X(HTML).
               </p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <p>Like HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0 has three sub-specifications: strict, transitional and frameset.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <p>Aside from the different opening declarations for a document, the differences between
                  an HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 document—in each of the corresponding DTDs—are largely
                  syntactic. The underlying syntax of HTML allows many shortcuts that XHTML does not,
                  such as elements with optional opening or closing tags, and even empty elements which
                  must not have an end tag. By contrast, XHTML requires all elements to have an opening
                  tag and a closing tag. XHTML, however, also introduces a new shortcut: an XHTML tag
                  may be opened and closed within the same tag, by including a slash before the end
                  of the tag like this: &lt;br/&gt;. The introduction of this shorthand, which is not used in the SGML declaration for
                  HTML 4.01, may confuse earlier software unfamiliar with this new convention. A fix
                  for this is to include a space before closing the tag, as such: &lt;br /&gt;.
               </p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <p>To understand the subtle differences between HTML and XHTML, consider the transformation
                  of a valid and well-formed XHTML 1.0 document that adheres to Appendix C (see below)
                  into a valid HTML 4.01 document. To make this translation requires the following steps:
               </p>

               <ol>

                        <em>The language for an element should be specified with a lang attribute rather than the XHTML xml:lang attribute.</em> XHTML uses XML's built in language-defining functionality attribute.

                  include the optional tags within an HTML document rather than remembering which tags
                  can be omitted.

                  as HTML (with a text/html

               <h1>Transitional versus strict</h1>
            </header>
            <div>
               <p>HTML 4 defined three different versions of the language: Strict, Transitional (once
                  called Loose) and Frameset. The Strict version is intended for new documents and is
                  considered best practice, while the Transitional and Frameset versions were developed
                  to make it easier to transition documents that conformed to older HTML specification
                  or didn't conform to any specification to a version of HTML 4. The Transitional and
                  Frameset versions allow for 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Presentational_markup&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">presentational markup</a>, which is omitted in the Strict version. Instead, 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_style_sheets">cascading style sheets</a> are encouraged to improve the presentation of HTML documents. Because XHTML 1 only
                  defines an XML syntax for the language defined by HTML 4, the same differences apply
                  to XHTML 1 as well.

               <p>As this list demonstrates, the loose versions of the specification are maintained
                  for legacy support. However, contrary to popular misconceptions, the move to XHTML
                  does not imply a removal of this legacy support. Rather the X in XML stands for extensible
                  and the W3C is modularizing the entire specification and opening it up to independent
                  extensions. The primary achievement in the move from XHTML 1.0 to XHTML 1.1 is the
                  modularization of the entire specification. The strict version of HTML is deployed
                  in XHTML 1.1 through a set of modular extensions to the base XHTML 1.1 specification.
                  Likewise, someone looking for the loose (transitional) or frameset specifications
                  will find similar extended XHTML 1.1 support (much of it is contained in the legacy
                  or frame modules). The modularization also allows for separate features to develop
                  on their own timetable. So for example, XHTML 1.1 will allow quicker migration to
                  emerging XML standards such as 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/MathML">MathML</a> (a presentational and semantic math language based on XML) and 
                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/XForms">XForms</a>—a new highly advanced web-form technology to replace the existing HTML forms.

               <p>In summary, the HTML 4 specification primarily reined in all the various HTML implementations
                  into a single clearly written specification based on SGML. XHTML 1.0, ported this
                  specification, as is, to the new XML defined specification. Next, XHTML 1.1 takes
                  advantage of the extensible nature of XML and modularizes the whole specification.
                  XHTML 2.0 was intended to be the first step in adding new features to the specification
                  in a standards-body-based approach.

                  <a href="http://wikipedia.org//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=HTML&amp;action=edit">[update]</a> both specifications are similar and mostly derived from each other, i.e., the work
                  on HTML5 started with an older WhatWG draft, and later the WhatWG 
                  <i>living standard</i> was based on HTML5 drafts in 2011.

               <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_link">fat links</a> and others. Even some hypertext features that were in early versions of HTML have been ignored
               by most popular web browsers until recently, such as the link element and in-browser
               Web page editing.
